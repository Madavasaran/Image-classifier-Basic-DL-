# Image-classifier-Basic-DL-
A simple implementation of CNN ( VGG19)


🧠 Image Classifier Web App (Flask + PyTorch)
This project is a simple and modern image classification web app built using:

Flask (for backend)

PyTorch (for the deep learning model)

HTML/CSS/JS (for a stylish, responsive frontend)

Users can upload an image, and the app will classify it using a pre-trained VGG19 (or any other) model and display the result dynamically on the page.
